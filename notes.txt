Usability and user experience(ux) are critical

Basic questions to be answered are
where am i (using breadcrumbs)
where can i go(using navigation)
what is here

Navigation is important for UX
it can be hierarchial where general to specific
it can be global where we can move to the home page from anywhere
it can be local where navigation occurs in same page

wireframing
drawing the hierarchy of the website

Breadcrumbs
Used to find where we are in the hierarchy
if we are in lol.html breadcrumb can be
home->about->new->lol
Consider album website
home -> albums -> album1 -> photos

Decide on relative or absolute links

Rules for good design
User experience must come before any code is written and must be consistent
    Who are the users? How to present info better?
    What is the page about?
    How long does it take for users to understand what content is on the page
    The website might look good but user has no idea about what the content is so keep that in mind - Edward Tufte deceptive pages
Simplicity
    What is it? news or product
    Where can i get it?
        Minimum number of clicks to get to content
    Why is it here?
        Get rid of useless content(if you cannot understand why you have used color just leave it to white)
        Dont use color just because it looks nice

To summarize
Give users what they want quickly
Be consistent
Dont pad website with images color etc which do not have proper meaning

Content and structure
HTML tags give the structure
The content can keep changing and hence to prevent repetetion of code we must have a way to create templates
